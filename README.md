# Helix Jump
  Cross-platform game(PC , Mobile).
# Intro :arrow_right:
  In Helix Jump, a ball bounces up and down on a series of circular platforms held up by a pole or maze. By sliding your finger left or right, you spin a platform or pole around until you reach a break in the floor, which will allow the ball to fall to the next level or next platform. Of course, your ultimate or main goal is to reach the bottom of the tower.
